# inclusive
`inclusive` is a **multilingual application** for **inclusive writing**. Languages evolve. Developed in Python, this application helps to write texts in an inclusive way. The application detects possibly problematic phrases and suggests some replacements. 

The application is configurable and it permits the users to add
* support for new languages
* add new suggestions to existing languages
* update suggestions

## Usage
To use `inclusive`, specify the language and enter a text

```
python -m inclusive.main en
```
![Running inclusive](./screenshot.png "Running inclusive")

Here, `en` corresponds to the English language.



It is also possible to specify a file.

```
python3 -m inclusive.main en filepath
```

A detailed desciption is present [here](./CONTRIBUTE.md).

## Test cases and coverage
All the test cases can be run in  the following manner
```
$ python3 -m tests.tests
```

Code coverage report can also be generated by running the unit tests using the coverage tool.
```
$ coverage run --source=inclusive -m unittest tests.tests
$ coverage report -m
```
